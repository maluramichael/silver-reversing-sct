description of mod:
---------------------
This mod extend the pauses you can take between the 3 steps of the bell code (3 rings, pause, 2 rings, pause, one ring)
to make the solution a bit easier. (also no need to obtain the code at the tavern anymore).

Instructions:
-------------
1. Just replace "towngate.sct" (provided in this directory) file with the original (you should probably make a backup first)

for me the original is located at: 
D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Silver\silver\levels\rain\towngate\towngate.sct
